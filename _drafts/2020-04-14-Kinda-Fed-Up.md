#### Work, work, work, School, school, school. This is starting to get old. Time to rant.

I'm just gonna go right out and say that this whole e-learning thing is so fucking annoying. I don't know if I say this now just because I'm fed up with doing my homework late at night when I want to be watching All American or playing video games, or if it's really just injustified. The teenager in me is going mad right now, that's it I guess. I know I'm not the only one like this just because I've talked with people at my job about it and a few friends on Snapchat.

What really sparked this whole thing was seeing a 3:00 due date on one of my English assignments for the second day in a row, on top of a 9:15 am mandatory zoom meeting. Like yeah, I get it, I need to stay involved with my teachers and my class but I haven't woke up before 11:00 am in 4 weeks. My sleep schedule is so __fucked.__ And now I'm stuck in a dilemma (a stupid, rebellious one, but a dilemma nonetheless). Half of me knows I need to get to bed on time, fix my sleep schedule, and be a better, more productive student and human being. However, the other half of me wants things to stay the way they are; I'll stay up even later, do the work when I want to get it done (still on time, of course), and give a big ol' _fuck you_ to all the authority figures. 

I'm stupid for thinking this, but the testosterone in me can't really shake it off at the moment. I'll be back to normal tomorrow morning most likely, but for now I really don't want to do anything school-related. This really is too much man, I don't know why considering the fact that I did more work when I was physically going to school, but it's just too much. There's no way for me to fit my daily goals and the schools system's daily goals into one 24 hour day. Not for me, and not for a million other 17 year olds.

Quite the rant this was. Probably won't be the last one you hear from me, but this is real, I promise you that. I made Skepliden as a place where I could put whatever I wanted, even a rant like this that just needs venting. Please don't consider me a worse person after writing this, as I believe this happens in everyone's brains, it just so happens that not many people put it on a website that can be viewed on all 196 million square miles of the Earth.

P.S The post dates I put in the titles ARE NOT FINAL. I'm trying to figure out a better way to do it. Maybe a site change is the way to go right now? I probably should focus on other things but you never know. My mind, like all, works in mysterious ways.

I'll be back with something less _punk rock-ish_ later.
