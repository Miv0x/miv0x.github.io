#### A prelude to a few ideas coming soon, a perspective on the future, and an ode to the bullshit that goes on in our brains.

It would be a lie to say that this past week has gone really well. As a matter of fact, while there were quite a few high moments, most of them I found were plagued with an anxiety. One about the future, people around me, and love. A few pretty important tests got me thinking this way, so I figured writing about it couldn't hurt. Every kid my age is worrying about what the future holds; A radical assumption, yes, but really everyone's scared for it in some way, shape, or form. 

For a reserved guy, I've found myself taking a weird amount of interest in the people around me as of late. Hell, I couldn't remember the last time I had cried before 2 weeks ago. Then all of a sudden, boom, three times or so last week I had cried for a few different individuals who have had it rough recently. I don't plan on going into details about it, for their privacy and for the sake of being _real_. This level of empathy I've had lately is strange, and I've honestly never experienced anything like it.


I plan on writing an article about willpower. The science behind it, why we do what we do. Maybe knowing how to manipulate it can help me stay on track with important goals of mine. Why would I rather play videogames than work on music? Do I really not like music enough? Research and make an article about it.
