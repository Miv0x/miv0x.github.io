# A prelude to a few ideas coming soon, a perspective on the future, and an ode to the bullshit that goes on in our brains

Hei everyone, I'm back with something.

## 03/01/20

It would be a lie to say that this past week has gone really well. As a matter of fact, while there were quite a few high moments, most of them I found were plagued with an anxiety. One about the future, people around me, and love. A few pretty important tests got me thinking this way, so I figured writing about it couldn't hurt. Every kid my age is worrying about what the future holds; A radical assumption, yes, but I wholeheartedly believe it to be true in most, if not all cases.

I continue writing this piece a few weeks later, most of which I've been _stuck_ inside doing nothing but sleeping in until 2:00 and playing videogames. A week ago I promised I would get something done, and I think we're actually making some leaps and bounds here. My methodology is a little scattered, but here's what I've been up to:

- We've got a domain! Finally no more _miv0x.github.io_, rather we have _skepliden.net_, making this site thing a little more official. It took me no more than half an hour this morning to get it all setup, and some cash out of my pocket, but that's irrelevant. Working on getting a favicon as we speak; I'm getting tired of looking at that weird piece of paper on the tab.
- Yessir.
