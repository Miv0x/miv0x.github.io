#### A prelude to a few ideas coming soon, a perspective on the future, and an ode to the bullshit that goes on in our brains.

It would be a lie to say that this past week has gone really well. As a matter of fact, while there were quite a few high moments, most of them I found were plagued with an anxiety. One about the future, people around me, and love. A few pretty important tests got me thinking this way, so I figured writing about it couldn't hurt. Every kid my age is worrying about what the future holds; A radical assumption, yes, but I wholeheartedly believe it to be true in most, if not all cases.



I plan on writing an article about willpower. The science behind it, why we do what we do. Maybe knowing how to manipulate it can help me stay on track with important goals of mine. Why would I rather play videogames than work on music? Do I really not like music enough? Research and make an article about it.
