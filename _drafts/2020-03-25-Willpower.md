####  An editorial on willpower; what it is, how it works, and how to use it. 

It's going to start with a draft. I'm going to put all of my sources in here, and take the time to work on it. I can always come back later with new research or new inspiration to write another paragraph. It can be as long or as short as I like.

Rough Sources:
- https://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2011/12/29/a-conversation-about-the-science-of-willpower/
- https://blog.ted.com/the-science-of-willpower-kelly-mcgonigal-on-why-its-so-dang-hard-to-stick-to-a-resolution/
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_fQvcBCNbA
- https://www.apa.org/helpcenter/willpower

Use these sources to gather some facts and pieces to use in the article, the introduction is going to come from that and a little bit of slick thinking. Get on it !!!

Willpower is often a term associated with a gym or diet, just as beginning an essay with a key term is "clich√©." It finds itself the roadblock of the public's summer body or the reason for the movie stars success. 


Willpower:
control exerted to do something or restrain impulses.
