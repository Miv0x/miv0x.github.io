Just wanna start this off by saying Denzel Curry's new EP _UNLOCKED_ is incredible. I'm not usually a rap guy, matter of fact, ask me about rap a month ago and I'd say I hate it. Modern day rap really sucks, but this thing has got a world of it's own. The sorta urban, free-flowing style is amazing, and I can't stop listening to it. It released a little more than 2 weeks prior to today and I'm still listening to it on the daily. With that out of the way, let's talk "important" things.
