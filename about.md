Skepliden for me is just somewhere to post kind of whatever I want when I want. I'd rather post things here than put them on places like Twitter or Instagram. 

### What the hell is a skepliden?

I have a weird obsession with Norway. I also have a weird obsession with the word _passion_. It's only natural that I shove the word in Google Translate, and move the letters around so it's not super obvious. I'll leave it to you to figure out what I changed from the original word. Chances are you don't care enough to do it, which is fair.
